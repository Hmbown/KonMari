# Gratitude Templates

*"By expressing gratitude toward the items you let go, it will lessen the feeling of guilt."*
— Marie Kondo

## Philosophy

In the KonMari Method, expressing gratitude before discarding is not optional — it's essential. The same applies to code. Every file, dependency, and configuration once served a purpose. Acknowledging that service creates psychological closure and reduces the guilt of deletion.

## Category 1: Dead Files (Clothing)

### Backup Files
- "Thank you, [filename], for the safety you provided during uncertain times. Version control now serves this purpose. Your work is complete."
- "Gratitude for being a safety net. You gave us confidence to experiment. That protection is no longer needed."
- "Thank you for preserving a moment in this project's history. That moment has passed, but its lessons remain."

### Temporary Files
- "Thank you, temp file, for your brief but useful existence. You served the moment perfectly."
- "Gratitude for being a workspace. You held our thoughts while we figured things out."
- "Thank you for the space you provided for experimentation."

### Debug Scripts
- "Thank you, debug script, for helping us understand what went wrong. The bug is fixed; your purpose is fulfilled."
- "Gratitude for shining light into the darkness. You revealed what we needed to see."
- "Thank you for your investigative service. The mystery is solved."

### Duplicate Files
- "Thank you for preserving redundancy. That caution is no longer necessary."
- "Gratitude for being a copy when copies mattered. We trust our version control now."
- "Thank you for the assurance you provided. We're confident enough to let go."

### AI Session Artifacts
- "Thank you, session notes, for documenting our conversation. Those decisions are now implemented."
- "Gratitude for capturing the context of that session. The work is done."
- "Thank you, PLAN.md, for guiding implementation. The plan is now reality."

## Category 2: Dependencies (Books)

### Unused Packages
- "Thank you, [package], for the capability you offered, even if unused. You taught us what tools exist."
- "Gratitude for being available. Sometimes knowing an option exists is enough."
- "Thank you for waiting patiently. We've decided to go a different direction."

### Orphaned Imports
- "Thank you, import, for connecting us to possibility. That connection is no longer needed."
- "Gratitude for the functionality you represented. We found another way."

### Experimental Dependencies
- "Thank you for the experiment. We learned from trying you, even if we didn't keep you."
- "Gratitude for helping us evaluate options. Your contribution to the decision was valuable."

## Category 3: Documentation (Papers)

### Outdated Documentation
- "Thank you, documentation, for attempting to guide future developers. Your guidance is now outdated, but your intent was pure."
- "Gratitude for capturing past understanding. The code has evolved, and so must the docs."
- "Thank you for trying to explain. A new explanation will take your place."

### Drifted READMEs
- "Thank you, README, for your original introduction. The project has grown beyond your description."
- "Gratitude for welcoming newcomers. A new welcome is needed now."

### Stale Tutorials
- "Thank you for teaching what you knew. Knowledge evolves, and so must teaching."

## Category 4: Configuration (Komono)

### Orphaned Config Files
- "Thank you, configuration, for the environment you once enabled. That tooling is gone, but you served it well."
- "Gratitude for the development environment you helped create. We've moved to new tools."
- "Thank you, .babelrc, for transforming our code. We use different transforms now."

### CI/CD Artifacts
- "Thank you for automating what needed automation. Our automation has evolved."
- "Gratitude for the pipeline you represented. A new pipeline serves us now."

### Old Tool Configs
- "Thank you, config file, for serving a tool that's no longer with us. The tool taught us something."

## Category 5: Legacy Code (Sentimental)

### Original Architecture
- "Deep gratitude to this code for getting the project to where it is today. You were the foundation."
- "Thank you for being the first attempt. All great things start somewhere."
- "Gratitude for the courage to begin. Starting is the hardest part."

### Founder Code
- "Thank you to whoever wrote this. Your vision started something that grew beyond you."
- "Gratitude for the seed you planted. The tree has grown."
- "Thank you for the first lines. Every journey begins with a single step."

### Deprecated Modules
- "Thank you, module, for serving users until now. Your service is complete."
- "Gratitude for the functionality you provided. A better way exists, but you paved the road."
- "Thank you for being the bridge. Bridges are meant to be crossed."

### Old Implementations
- "Thank you for the lesson in what didn't work. Failure teaches more than success."
- "Gratitude for showing us the boundaries. Now we know where not to go."
- "Thank you for trying. Not every experiment succeeds, but all experiments teach."

## Generic Templates

For any file type:
- "Thank you, [filename], for your service to this project."
- "Gratitude for the purpose you served. Your purpose has been fulfilled."
- "Thank you for being part of this project's journey. Every journey has stages that end."
- "Gratitude for what you taught us. The lesson remains even as you go."
- "Thank you for your contribution, however brief. All contributions matter."

## Using Gratitude in Practice

### Quick Wins (High Confidence)
For files with confidence >= 80%, use a brief acknowledgment:
> "Thank you, [filename], for your service. Your purpose is complete."

### Decisions Needed (Medium Confidence)
For files requiring judgment, use a reflective template:
> "Let's consider [filename]. It served [purpose]. Does its purpose continue, or is it time to let go with gratitude?"

### Legacy Code (Low Confidence)
For sentimental items, use a full acknowledgment:
> "Before we consider [filename], let's acknowledge its history. This code [description of service]. Thank you for [specific contribution]. If we decide to let go, we do so with deep gratitude for the foundation it provided."

## The Gratitude Ritual

1. **Hold the file in your mind** - What did it do? Why did it exist?
2. **Acknowledge its service** - It was created to solve a problem
3. **Express gratitude** - Use an appropriate template
4. **Release with respect** - Deletion is not destruction; it's completion
